## Strategic Priorities for September - November 2021

<!--
For strategic priorities, be sure to list:
  1. The strategic priority
  2. Any additional information that's necessary to clarify the strategic
     priority beyond just the name.
  3. Why the priority matters.
-->

1. **Expand the reach and impact of NatCap science and information beyond a
   research community**
   In order to inform real-world decisions, the Ecosystem Services analyses and
   resulting information must be made available and accessible to individuals
   and organizations outside of the research community. We believe we can
   accomplish this for NatCap's science and information by:
        1. Developing and supporting reproducible data pipelines that reduce
           the effort in keeping Ecosystem Service assessments current, and
        2. Maintaining data-access APIs as an endpoint of these workflows
           in order to facilitate access to Ecosystem Services information
           and allow the broader community to develop their own creative
           uses for this information.

2. **Expand the user base of InVEST to include more of the research and
   modeling community**
   While some consumers of NatCap's science and information will only require
   access to existing workflows and results, others have unique use cases
   requiring their own analyses. We believe we can lower the barrier for
   entry for these researchers and expand access by:
        1. Making the InVEST user interface and documentation more accessible
           to more users and,
        2. Maintaining user-friendly programmatic interfaces to the InVEST
           software.

3. **Build technical capacity among NatCap science teams**
   We believe that reducing friction for scientists to design and prototype
   reproducible research workflows for Ecosystem Services analyses would
   empower our colleagues to do more impactful, reproducible work.  Workflows
   produced by scientific staff might eventually find support under priority 1.
   We believe we can do this through high-leverage activities such as:
        1. Maintaining a cookbook of common development patterns for Ecosystem
           Services analyses with a focus on InVEST, pygeoprocessing and taskgraph.
        2. Being available to consult with scientists on their scripting and/or
           data problems.

4. **Support and Maintain InVEST**
   The continued support and maintenance of InVEST, through bugfixes and user
   support through our forums, is a distinguishing feature of InVEST among
   ecosystem services models, and is a level of support that is rare to find
   among scientific software packages. We believe that maintaining this level
   of support is a crucial component of getting our models into the hands of
   decision-makers. This support and maintenance is a necessary prerequisite of
   strategic priorities #2 and #3.

5. **Implement New InVEST Models**
   As new high-impact Ecosystem Services science becomes available, producing
   performant, efficient implementations of these models and supporting them
   as part of the InVEST suite is a critical step towards getting these models
   into the hands of decision-makers, and also in enabling other science to
   use these models in reproducible workflows.

## What we're working on

This section may include specific projects or more general areas of improvement
that are less user facing but that are important for us to address.

<!--

For each item, be sure to include:
  1. The item we're working on (just the title or a reference label is fine)
  2. Links to any relevant github issues/projects/repos/etc for an overview
  3. Estimated completion date
  4. The strategic objectives (from above) that the task contributes to.
